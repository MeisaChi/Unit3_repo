# Unit 3: ISAK Free Store App
## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
**Client:** A student from UWC ISAK Japan

**Context:** 


**Problem:** 


## Proposed Solution

## Design Statement



## Success Criteria

1. The solution provides a visual representation of the Humidity and Temperature values inside a dormitory (Local) and outside the house (Remote) for a period of minimum 48 hours. 
2. The solution provides a mathematical modelling for the Humidity and Temperature levels for each Local and Remote locations. ```(SL: linear model)```
3. The solution provides a comparative analysis for the Humidity and Temperature levels for each Local and Remote locations including mean, standad deviation, minimum, maximum, and median.
4. ```(SL)```The Local samples are stored in a csv file.
5. Create a prediction the subsequent 12 hours for both temperature and humidity.
6. A poster summarizing the visual representations, model and analysis is created and communicated.
