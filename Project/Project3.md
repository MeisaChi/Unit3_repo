# Unit 3: ISAK Free Store App
## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
**Client:** A student from UWC ISAK Japan

**Context:** UWC ISAK Japan has a free store, where anyone can leave their clothes and other items that they  to give, and anyone can take them for free. But there is so much stuff that it is difficult for the students to look through and check if they want anything from there! A teacher assigned a student in ISAK, who is our client for this program. The client tried everything - requesting for a larger free store, which hadn't worked because there is limited space in ISAK, she also tried sorting out and making the free store more visible, but everyday things were added and taken, that the free store went back to being messy in a week. The client wants a program that she can use on her MacBook which helps her and her schoolmates use the free store efficiently, as there are a lot of good resources there. She wants a well designed software so that it is easy for the students in ISAK to use.


**Problem:** The free store is unorganized, and difficult to use. As the client is a student, she wants the production cost to be as low as possible.


## Proposed Solution

Considering the budget limitations and the context of the problem, the solution that I propose for the client is Python. Python 
Considering the budgetary constrains of the client and the hardware requirements, the software tool that I proposed for this solution is Python. Python is open source, it is mature and supported in mutiple platforms (platform-independent) including macOS, Windows, Linux and can also be used to program the Arduino microprocessor 56. In comparison to the alternative C or C++, which share similar features, Python is a High level programming language (HLL) with high abstraction 7. For example, memory management is automatic in Python whereas it is responsability of the C/C++ developer to allocate and free up memory 7, this could result in faster applications but also memory problems. In addition a HLL language will allow me and future developers extend the solution or solve issues proptly.

## Design Statement



## Success Criteria

1. The application will be a well-designed GUI, with a login screen, sign-up screen, home screen, table screen and a adding screen.
2. The application allows the user to login and logout, or register and the user data will be stored in a database.
3. The user information (password) in the database will be securely stored, encrypted using a hash system.
4. The application will allow the user enter all attributes (category, brand, size, color, description, condition) for an item and add an item into the database 
5. The application will allow the user to find a table of items, and remove items from the free store database.
6. The application will allow the user to search for a specific attribute (category, brand, size, color, description, condition), and find an specific item.
